# cluster-blood-cells

Autoencoder is widely applied in deep learning. By applying autoencoder, this work  clusters and classfies different type of blood cells, compares encoding results from UMAP and t-sne, and results from CITE-seq data and RNA-seq data only.

## Data source   
Data files `metadata.csv.gz`, `protein_scale.csv.gz` and `rna_scale.csv.gz` used in this work are generated by running the R script `processing.R`.

## Softwares and packages
Softwares applied in this project are mainly `Python` (version 3.9.12) and `R` (version 4.2.0). Package `PyTorch` in `Python` is used for deep learning, and packages `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` in `R` are used for data analysis and plotting.

## Scripts  
Scripts, including `Python` scripts and `R` scripts applied in this project are attached in the zipped file.
